# Task 6 By Avtaar Training Program

### Problem Statement -

Given a list of some 100 items where item has 
 - _Item Name_
 - _Owner Name_
 - _Bookend until - Date_

**Task -**

Display them in a scrollable list to display all these details in either form - a webpage or mobile application.

On reaching the end of the list, show the button to scroll back to top button.

**Task Type -**

  **_UI Developement_**

**Expected Output should look like -**

  * Screenshot of the UI - 1st 10 items.
  * Screenshot of the next page.
  * Screenshot of the end of the list with the scroll back to the top button.

### Technology / language used - 
**_HTML_**, **_CSS_**, **_JavaScript_** 

### IDE / tools used -
**_Visual Studio Code_**

### Solution approach - 

Since, the list needs to be dynamic and changeable. Hence, to satisfy this condition, the concept of arrays in javascript has been used. Using a for loop, li's have been dynamically added alongwith the data. Therefore, anychange change in data would be reflected on the list as well. For testing puprose, the data that array contains has been totally kept random.

The another condition is to make a **scroll back-to-top** button at the very end of the list which is also satisfied and is resulting into a smooth scroll to top without refreshing the page.

#### Additional feature -

1. The custom or **default scrollbar** has been customized and re-styled to match with the design needs of page.

2. Alongwith that, the webpage is fully **responsible** and **flexible**, keeping users in mind.

3. Too much contrast has been avoided as colors and theme are chosen to sooth the eyes and focus of user.


### How to run the project after cloning / forking -

No headache is involved, since only html, css and javascript has been used which can easily be executed on any of your chosen web browser (preferably Chrome).

Still, simple steps are - 
1. Download zip or clone the code. Then move to the folder where the files for this project resides.

2. Now simply double click on **"index.html"**. Your default browser will open this file for you and that's it. You have successfully executed the project.
